I'm a big fan of web accessibility and believe the web should be accessible to all and not just me. I love applying responsive design principles and watching my web pages shrink into mobile screens and still look amazing. I think in a way the human brain is kind of like those web pages, malleable.

My specialties include quickly learning new skills and programming languages, problem solving, responsive design principles and web optimization. So far I have React, Next js,Vue js under my belt. I just started learning gsap. I'm still enthusiastically grabbing onto any other programming languages, framework or principles I can integrate to become a better software engineer.
